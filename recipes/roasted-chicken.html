        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>&#189; cup butter</li>
                <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F (175° C)</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a roasting pan. Season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the chicken's outside.</li>
            <li>Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
